 * Class ID: 139
 * Assignment #: 1
 * 
 * Description:
 * 	SimpleList is an array of ten integers. Integers can be added with the add
 * method and integers can be removed with the remove method. The count method
 * returns the number of added integers in the SimpleList.
 * 
 * 	When integers are added, the contents of the SimpleList are shifted to the
 * right, to the next higher index value, and the new integer is inserted into
 * index 0. The count is then incremented. When the SimpleList is full and a 
 * new integer is being added, the last integer essentially "falls off" and is
 * lost. The count remains the same because the number of integers in the 
 * SimpleList has not changed.
 * 
 * 	When integers are removed, the search method finds the integer in the
 * SimpleList and returns the index of that integer. Otherwise, the search
 * method returns a -1. Using that index, the contents of the SimpleList are
 * shifted to the left, to the next lower index value, starting from that index
 * from the search method. The integer is essentially overwritten. Finally, the
 * last integer of the SimpleList is cleared to 0 and the count is decremented.
 * If the queried integer is not found in the SimpleList, which the search
 * method returns a -1, the SimpleList is not modified and the remove method
 * exits.
 * 
 *	The toString method returns the SimpleList as a String. The String returned
 * is the integers in the SimpleList separated by a space. However, the last
 * integer in the String does not have a space after it.
