 * Class ID: 139
 * Assignment #: 2
 * 
 * Description:
 * 	SimpleList, by default, is an array of ten integers. Integers can be added
 * with the add method and integers can be removed with the remove method. The
 * count method returns the number of added integers in the SimpleList.
 * 
 * 	When integers are added, the contents of the SimpleList are shifted to the
 * right, to the next higher index value, and the new integer is inserted into
 * index 0. The count is then incremented. If the SimpleList is full when a
 * new integer is being added, the size of the SimpleList is increased by 50%
 * before inserting a new integer. The count is then incremented.
 * 
 * 	When integers are removed, the search method finds the integer in the
 * SimpleList and returns the index of that integer. Otherwise, the search
 * method returns a -1. Using that index, the contents of the SimpleList are
 * shifted to the left, to the next lower index value, starting from that index
 * from the search method. The integer is essentially overwritten. After the
 * integer has been removed, if there is more than 25% of unused space in the
 * SimpleList, then the size of the SimpleList is decreased by 25%. If the
 * queried integer is not found in the SimpleList, which the search method
 * returns a -1, the SimpleList is not modified and the remove method exits.
 * 
 *	The toString method returns the SimpleList as a String. The String returned
 * is the integers in the SimpleList separated by a space. However, the last
 * integer in the String does not have a space after it.
 * 
 *  When integers are appended, they are appended to the end of the SimpleList.
 * If the SimpleList is full when a new integer is being appended, the size of
 * the SimpleList is increased by 50% before appending a new integer. The count
 * is then incremented.
 * 
 *  The first method simply returns the first element in the SimpleList at
 * index 0.
 * 
 *  The last method simply returns the last element in the SimpleList.
